Noteworthy changes in release 1.4

* The `mpileup` command moved from samtools to bcftools. The basic
  functionality remains unchanged and so does most of the command line 
  options, but there are differences one should be aware of:

  - The option `samtools mpileup -t, --output-tags` changed to `bcftools
    mpileup -a, --annotate`. The short -t option has a different meaning
    in bcftools, consistent with the rest of bcftools commands. 

  - The option `-d, --depth .. max per-file depth` now behaves as expected
    amd according to the documentation, and prints a meaningful diagnostics.
