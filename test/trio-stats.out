# DEF lines define expressions for all tested thresholds
# FLT* lines report numbers for every threshold and every trio:
#   1) filter id
#   2) child
#   3) father
#   4) mother
#   5) number of valid trio genotypes (pass filters, all non-missing)
#   6) number of non-reference trio GTs
#   7) number of Mendelian errors
#   8) number of novel singleton alleles in the child (counted also as a Mendelian error)
#   9) number of singleton alleles, present only in one parent and not transmitted to the child
#   10) number of doubleton alleles, present only in one parent and the child
#   11) number of transitions, all ALT alleles present in the trio are considered
#   12) number of transversions, all ALT alleles present in the trio are considered
#   13) overall ts/tv, all ALT alleles present in the trio are considered
